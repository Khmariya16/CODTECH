# Overview of the Project


### Project Overview: task1 - House Price Prediction Model
> #### Objective
##### The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to determine whether a house's price is above or below the median price using the provided dataset Housing.csv. The dataset includes various features about houses, such as area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and other amenities. We will use logistic regression for classification purposes.

> **Libraries Used**
##### pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
##### numpy: For numerical operations.
##### matplotlib: For data visualization.
##### seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
##### scikit-learn: For machine learning model building and evaluation.

>
> #### Key Insights
##### 1. The data was cleaned to handle missing values and convert categorical variables to a numerical format.
##### 2. Exploratory data analysis revealed significant correlations between certain features and house prices.
##### 3. The logistic regression model was able to classify house prices with a certain degree of accuracy, providing insights into which factors most influence whether a house's price is above or below the median.
